# k6 Performance Testing Project

## Overview

This project contains performance tests written using k6. It's designed to help you assess the performance and reliability of your applications under various load conditions.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and k6 installed.

1.  **Install Node.js:** Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Install k6:** Follow the instructions on the official k6 website: [k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/](https://k6.io/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Once Node.js is installed, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## How to Run Tests

To run the performance tests, use the k6 command-line tool. For example, to run `tests/test.js`:

```bash
k6 run tests/test.js
```

To run the traffic test:

```bash
k6 run tests/traffic_test.ts
```

If you have a TypeScript test file like `tests/test.ts` or `tests/traffic_test.ts`, you might need to transpile it first or use a tool like `ts-node` if your k6 setup supports it. A common approach is to compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

```bash
npx tsc tests/test.ts tests/traffic_test.ts
k6 run tests/test.js
k6 run tests/traffic_test.js
```

## How to View Reports

After a test run, k6 can generate various types of reports. This project is configured to output results to `reports/result.json` or `reports/results.json`.

To view a basic summary in the console after a run, k6 provides a default output. For more detailed analysis, you can use tools that process the JSON output.

For example, to generate an HTML report from the `results.json` file, you might use a third-party tool or a custom script. If you have `k6-html-reporter` installed (as per your `package.json`):

```bash
npm install
```

To generate the HTML report using the `generatesummaryreport.ts` script:

First, ensure `results.json` has been generated by your k6 run (e.g., by adding `--out json=results.json` to your k6 run command).

Then, compile and run the report generation script:

```bash
npx tsc scripts/generatesummaryreport.ts
node scripts/generatesummaryreport.js
```

This will generate `results_html.html` in the `reports` directory.

*(Note: Ensure `results.json` is generated by your k6 run command. You might need to add `--out json=results.json` to your k6 run command.)*
